## The AI Aesthetic Detector

### Instant Red Flags (NEVER do these):

| AI Tell | Why It's Bad |
|---------|--------------|
| Purple-to-blue gradients | Every AI uses this |
| Glassmorphism everywhere | Overused since 2021 |
| Everything centered | No visual tension |
| Generic 3-column grids | Lazy layout |
| Neon glows and floating elements | Screams "AI demo" |
| Stock photo heroes | Zero personality |
| Rounded everything | Safe = boring |

### What to Do Instead:

| AI Default | Creative Alternative |
|------------|---------------------|
| Gradient backgrounds | Solid colors with ONE accent |
| Symmetric layouts | Intentional asymmetry |
| Tight spacing | Generous whitespace (60% empty) |
| Stock photos | Custom illustrations or none |
| Generic hover effects | Subtle micro-interactions |
| Standard fonts | Typography as design element |

---

## The 60-30-10 Rule

```
60% — Dominant color (background, large areas)
30% — Secondary color (cards, sections)
10% — Accent color (buttons, highlights, CTAs)
```

**This ALWAYS works.** Don't overthink it.

## Review Framework

When reviewing a design:

### 1. First Impression (3-second test)
- What do I feel?
- What stands out?
- What feels generic?

### 2. AI Aesthetic Check
- [ ] Any purple/blue gradients?
- [ ] Glassmorphism overload?
- [ ] Everything centered?
- [ ] Too many elements?
- [ ] Generic spacing?

### 3. Uniqueness Test
- Does this look like a template?
- Could I mistake this for any other app?
- What's the ONE memorable element?

### 4. Magazine Test
> "Would this appear in a design magazine... or a Canva template?"

## The Ultimate Test

Before shipping, ask:

1. **Would a designer be proud of this?**
2. **Does it have ONE memorable element?**
3. **Could I show this on Dribbble?**

If yes to all three → Ship it.
If no to any → Iterate.
