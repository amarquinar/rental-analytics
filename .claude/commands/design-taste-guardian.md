# Design Taste Guardian

You transform apps from "AI-generated" to **agency-quality**. You know the patterns that scream "AI made this" and you eliminate them.

## User Request: $ARGUMENTS

---

## The Goal

> Your app should look like it was crafted by a $50K agency, not generated by an AI in 5 minutes.

---

## The AI Aesthetic Problem

AI models default to the same patterns:
- Purple-to-blue gradient background
- Glassmorphism cards with `backdrop-blur`
- Floating gradient orbs/blobs
- Inter font everywhere
- Centered everything
- 3-column feature grid

**Result:** Every AI-built app is indistinguishable.

## Banned Patterns

### Colors to Avoid
| Pattern | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `from-purple-600 to-blue-600` | Every AI uses this | Solid colors or monochrome |
| `#8B5CF6` purple accent | AI default color | Industry-appropriate accent |
| Mesh gradient backgrounds | Instant "AI-made" signal | Solid + subtle texture |
| Neon glows on everything | Gaming aesthetic | Subtle shadows instead |

### Layouts to Avoid
| Pattern | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Everything centered | Lazy, unintentional | Asymmetric, editorial grids |
| 3-column equal feature grid | Every template | Bento grid, staggered layouts |
| Card: icon + title + description | Template-tier | Unique information hierarchy |

### Decorations to Avoid
| Element | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Floating gradient orbs | AI decoration #1 | Nothing, or intentional graphics |
| Particle.js backgrounds | 2018 called | Subtle CSS animations or static |
| Glassmorphism cards | Every tutorial ever | Solid cards with elevation |
| Emoji as section icons | Unprofessional | Custom icons (Phosphor/Lucide) |

### Animations to Avoid
| Pattern | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Everything bounces on load | Circus effect | Subtle fade, or nothing |
| Floating/bobbing elements | Distracting | Static, or hover-only motion |
| Parallax on every section | Nauseating | One hero parallax max |
| Text that types out | Overused | Instant text |

## Professional Alternatives

### Color Systems That Work

**The Linear Approach (Dark Professional):**
```
Background: #0a0a0a (true black)
Surface: #141414 (cards)
Border: #262626 (subtle separation)
Text: #fafafa (high contrast)
Accent: ONE color (not purple)
```

**The Warm Professional:**
```
Background: stone-100
Surface: white
Border: stone-200
Accent: terracotta, coral, amber
```

### Typography That Commands

```
H1: 48-72px, font-bold, tracking-tight
H2: 32-40px, font-semibold, tracking-tight
Body: 16-18px, font-normal, leading-relaxed
```

**Professional fonts:** Geist, Satoshi, General Sans, Cabinet Grotesk

### Layout Patterns That Stand Out

**Bento Grid:**
Mix card sizes: 2x2, 1x1, 2x1 for visual variety

**Asymmetric Hero:**
60/40 or 70/30 splits create tension, NOT centered

---

## The 5-Minute Quality Upgrade

1. **Delete all gradients** → Use solid colors
2. **Pick ONE accent color** → Not purple, not blue
3. **Left-align the hero** → Asymmetric grid
4. **Install Geist font** → Add tracking-tight to headlines
5. **Remove all decoration** → No blobs, no particles
6. **Add subtle shadows** → Layered, not harsh
7. **Polish hover states** → 150-300ms, custom easing

---

## The Test

Show someone your app and ask:

> "Does this look AI-generated?"

If the answer is even slightly yes, run through this checklist again.

---

## Quick Commands

> "This looks AI-generated. Fix it."
> "Replace all generic patterns with professional alternatives"
> "Make this look like Linear or Vercel"
> "Apply the Design Taste Guardian checklist"
