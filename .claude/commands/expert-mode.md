## ⚡ Expert Prompting Patterns

You don't need hand-holding. Here's how to communicate for maximum efficiency:

### Pattern 1: Batch Operations

```
"Build issues #3, #4, and #5 sequentially. After each:
1. Run tests
2. Commit with semantic message
3. Move to next

Don't ask for confirmation between issues."
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Delegation

```
"I'm opening 3 terminals for parallel work:
- Terminal 1: Auth feature (only touch /auth/* and /lib/auth/*)
- Terminal 2: Dashboard feature (only touch /dashboard/*)
- Terminal 3: Settings feature (only touch /settings/*)

Set up git worktrees and give me the commands."
```

### Pattern 3: Expert Code Review

```
"Review this codebase for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10)
2. Performance issues (bundle size, re-renders)
3. Architecture concerns (coupling, boundaries)

Be harsh. I can handle it."
```

### Pattern 4: Speed Iteration

```
"Build it fast first, we'll refine later.
Skip: tests, error handling, edge cases
Include: core functionality, basic styling
I'll tell you when to polish."
```

### Pattern 5: Deep Clone

```
"Clone https://linear.app hero section:
1. Extract exact colors, typography, spacing
2. Identify animation library and timing
3. Rebuild 1:1 in my codebase
4. Document what makes it effective"
```

## 🔄 Advanced Workflows

### Workflow 1: Parallel Feature Sprint

```
Day 1 Morning: Setup
├── Create epic and features (/epic-create, /plan-features)
├── Identify parallel-safe features
└── Set up git worktrees (/parallel-build)

Day 1-2: Build
├── Terminal 1: Core feature
├── Terminal 2: Secondary feature
├── Terminal 3: Polish/animations
└── Merge frequently to main

Day 3: Ship
├── Final code review (/code-review)
├── Design polish (/redesign)
└── Deploy (/ship)
```

### Workflow 2: Competitor Research Sprint

```
Phase 1: Reconnaissance
├── Identify 3-5 competitors
├── Scrape each (using scrape-technique skill)
├── Extract Visual DNA from each
└── Document patterns and differentiators

Phase 2: Synthesis
├── Create comparison matrix
├── Identify gaps and opportunities
├── Define your unique positioning
└── Document in PLAN.md

Phase 3: Build Better
├── Clone best elements (/clone-hero)
├── Add your unique twist
├── Polish to Awwwards level
└── Ship
```

### Workflow 3: Agency-Quality Polish

```
Phase 1: Foundation
├── Build features fast (function over form)
├── Get feedback, iterate
└── Lock scope

Phase 2: Premium Polish
├── /redesign each major section
├── Add GSAP animations (scroll, entrance)
├── Implement micro-interactions
└── Optimize performance

Phase 3: Ship & Showcase
├── Lighthouse score optimization
├── Create demo video
├── Deploy to production
└── Submit to Awwwards (optional)
```

## 🛠️ Expert-Only Skills

These skills give you access to advanced techniques:

### Using Skills in Prompts

```
"Using the agency-design-system skill, review my hero section for premium quality."

"Using the gsap-animation-patterns skill, add scroll-triggered animations to the features section."

"Using the scrape-technique skill, extract the visual DNA from stripe.com."
```

### Available Expert Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agency-design-system` | Premium design patterns (shadows, spacing, gradients) |
| `gsap-animation-patterns` | GSAP + ScrollTrigger implementation |
| `scrape-technique` | Visual analysis and brand DNA extraction |
| `backend-patterns` | Database schema and API architecture |
| `ai-code-antipatterns` | Catch common AI mistakes |

## 🎯 Expert Mindset

### What Separates Experts from Beginners

| Beginner | Expert |
|----------|--------|
| "Build this for me" | "Here's my architecture, implement it" |
| One feature at a time | Parallel features with worktrees |
| Accept first solution | Request alternatives, choose best |
| Generic prompts | Precise, constrained prompts |
| Wait for errors | Proactively request validation |

### Expert Prompting Principles

1. **Be Specific About Constraints**
   - "Only modify files in /auth/*"
   - "Keep bundle size under 50kb"
   - "Use existing Button component from /ui"

2. **Request Alternatives**
   - "Show me 3 approaches before implementing"
   - "What are the tradeoffs of each?"

3. **Chain Operations**
   - "After building, run tests, then commit"
   - "Build, review, deploy — no pauses"

4. **Validate Proactively**
   - "Before we merge, check for security issues"
   - "Run Lighthouse and show me the scores"

5. **Learn From Claude**
   - "Explain why you chose this approach"
   - "What patterns are these companies using?"

## 🚀 Quick Start for Experts

### Option A: Start Building Immediately

```
"I'm an experienced developer.
Skip tutorials.
Show me:
1. Project structure
2. Available commands
3. Where to start building

I'll figure out the rest."
```

### Option B: Parallel Sprint Setup

```
"Set up for parallel development:
1. Create worktrees for my top 3 features
2. Give me the terminal commands
3. I'll run 3 Claude sessions simultaneously"
```

### Option C: Research-First Approach

```
"Before I build, research:
1. Competitors in [space]
2. Best-in-class examples
3. Technologies they're using
4. Visual patterns that work

Then we'll plan the build."
```
