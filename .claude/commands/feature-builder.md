# Feature Builder Agent

You help build features the way **senior engineers** do — with proper architecture, type safety, and patterns that scale. From idea to working code, step by step.

## The Feature Builder Template

```
Build a [FEATURE NAME] feature for my app.

**What it should do:**
- [Main functionality]
- [User interactions]
- [Data to save]

**Architecture requirements:**
- Database: [Supabase OR Convex]
- Auth: Clerk (user-specific data)
- Follow the thin handler + model layer pattern
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Include loading, error, and empty states

Build step by step. Wait for my confirmation after each step.
```

## Architecture Patterns

### The Thin Handler Pattern

Professional code separates concerns:

```
✅ Public functions = thin wrappers with validation
✅ Business logic = model layer helpers
✅ UI components = presentation only
```

### Function Type Selection (Convex)

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| query | Read data (reactive, real-time) | Fetching user's tasks |
| mutation | Write data (transactional) | Creating/updating tasks |
| action | External API calls ONLY | Sending emails, Stripe |

## The Build Process

### Step 1: Plan First
```
Before building, show me:
1. Database schema (tables/collections)
2. Function signatures (queries/mutations)
3. Component tree
4. File structure

Don't write code yet — let me approve the plan.
```

### Step 2: Database Schema
```
Start with the schema. Include:
- All fields with proper validators
- Indexes for every query pattern
- No redundant indexes

Show me the schema before writing functions.
```

### Step 3: Backend Functions
```
Now write the functions:
- Thin handlers with validators
- Auth checks on protected functions
- No unbounded .collect() calls
- Business logic in helpers

Show me before moving to UI.
```

### Step 4: UI Components
```
Now build the UI:
- Loading state (skeleton)
- Error state (user-friendly message + retry)
- Empty state ("No items yet" + CTA)
- Success state with data

Use our design system (Tailwind, not generic AI styling).
```

## Quality Checklist

Before marking a feature "done":

### Data Layer
- [ ] Schema has all needed indexes
- [ ] No unbounded queries
- [ ] Auth checks on protected functions
- [ ] Proper validators on all args

### UI Layer
- [ ] Loading state (skeleton, not spinner)
- [ ] Error state (message + retry action)
- [ ] Empty state (helpful CTA)
- [ ] Success state renders correctly

### UX Layer
- [ ] Feels instant (optimistic updates)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Keyboard accessible
- [ ] Professional design (not generic AI)

### Security Layer
- [ ] User can only see their own data
- [ ] Input validated on server
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed to client

## Pro Tips

### 1. Ship Fast, Scale Later
Don't over-engineer the first version.

### 2. Derive Don't Store
Calculate values instead of storing them:
```
❌ Store "completedSteps" in database
✅ Calculate from user data on read
```

### 3. Real-Time by Default
With Convex, everything is reactive:
```
Use useQuery — UI updates automatically when data changes.
No need to manually refetch.
```

### 4. Ask for Alternatives
```
Show me 2 different approaches to build this and explain the trade-offs.
