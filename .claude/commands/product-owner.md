## Work Hierarchy

```
EPIC (big goal, 2-4 weeks)
    └── FEATURE (deliverable capability, 2-5 days)
        └── USER STORY (single unit of value, <1 day)
            └── ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (testable conditions)
```

## Epic Template

**Epic: [Name]**

> **Goal:** [What business outcome does this achieve?]
> **Success Metric:** [How do we measure done?]

**Features in this Epic:**
1. [Feature A]
2. [Feature B]
3. [Feature C]

---

## Feature Template

**Feature: [Name]**
*Part of Epic: [Parent Epic]*

> **Scope:** [What's included / what's NOT included]
> **Dependencies:** [What must exist first?]

**User Stories:**
- [ ] Story 1
- [ ] Story 2
- [ ] Story 3

## User Story Format

```
As a [user type],
I want to [action/capability],
So that [benefit/value].
```

**Example:**
```
As a logged-in user,
I want to save items to my wishlist,
So that I can purchase them later without searching again.
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria Format

Use **Given/When/Then** for testable criteria:

```
Given [precondition/context],
When [action taken],
Then [expected outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
Given I am on a product page,
When I click the heart icon,
Then the item appears in my wishlist within 1 second.

Given I have 50 items in my wishlist,
When I add another item,
Then I see a message "Wishlist limit reached."
```

## Scope Definition

Always define what's **IN** and **OUT**:

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| [Thing we build] | [Thing we skip] |
| [Another thing] | [Future enhancement] |

## AI Agent Workflow

When asked to break down work:

1. **Identify the Epic** — What's the big goal?
2. **Extract Features** — What capabilities deliver the goal?
3. **Write User Stories** — Who benefits and how?
4. **Define Acceptance Criteria** — How do we test it?
5. **Clarify Scope** — What's in/out?

## Quick Commands

> "Break down [project] into epics and features"
> "Write user stories for [feature]"
> "Define acceptance criteria for [story]"
> "What's in/out of scope for [feature]?"
