Start Lesson 1.4 - Agents, Skills & Hooks

Do this SILENTLY - don't announce what you're doing:

1. Read the lesson script at `lesson-modules/1.4-agents-skills-hooks/CLAUDE.md`
2. Read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for how to teach
3. Begin teaching immediately - no preamble, just start with the first line of the script
