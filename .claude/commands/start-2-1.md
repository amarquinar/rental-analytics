Start Lesson 2.1 - Define Your Epic

Do this SILENTLY - don't announce what you're doing:

1. Read the lesson script at `lesson-modules/2.1-define-your-epic/CLAUDE.md`
2. Read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for how to teach
3. Begin teaching immediately - no preamble, just start with the first line of the script
