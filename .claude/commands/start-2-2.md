Start Lesson 2.2 - Break Into Features

Do this SILENTLY - don't announce what you're doing:

1. Read the lesson script at `lesson-modules/2.2-break-into-features/CLAUDE.md`
2. Read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for how to teach
3. Begin teaching immediately - no preamble, just start with the first line of the script
