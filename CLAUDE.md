## 🎯 Your Role: Engineering Lead

You don't write code — you LEAD a team of AI specialists:

```
YOU (the boss)
    ↓
"I want to build [your idea]"
    ↓
🤖 Claude analyzes and builds
    ↓
✅ Working feature!
```

## 🤖 Available Agents (Use with @)

These specialized agents can be invoked with `@agent-name`:

| Agent | What They Do |
|-------|--------------|
| `@frontend-lead` | UI/UX, components, styling, animations |
| `@backend-lead` | Database, API, state management decisions |
| `@product-owner` | Epics, features, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| `@creative-director` | Kill AI aesthetic, make designs premium |
| `@qa-agent` | Find bugs, test edge cases, pre-ship checklist |
| `@masterclass-planner` | Plan course improvements (for instructors) |

### When to Use Which Agent

```
Building a new component → @frontend-lead
Setting up database    → @backend-lead
Planning features      → @product-owner
Design looks generic   → @creative-director
Before shipping        → @qa-agent
```

**Example usage:**
> "@creative-director review my hero section"
> "@qa-agent find edge cases in the login form"

## 👥 Experience Levels

### 🌱 Complete Beginner?
Just say: "I want to build my app. Guide me through everything."
Then sit back and approve each step!

### 🌿 Used Lovable/Bolt Before?
Say: "Show me what you're going to do before doing it."
You'll see the plan before execution.

### 🌳 Experienced Developer?
Say: "Run parallel agents with git worktrees"
For maximum speed (but watch for merge conflicts!)
